bio: |
  Contributing to the Ansible for IBM Z ecosystem. With over five years of experience
  in systems automation and infrastructure engineering, I specialize in bridging
  legacy mainframe environments with modern DevOps practices. When I'm not writing
  playbooks, I'm tinkering with my homelab or contributing to open source projects.
